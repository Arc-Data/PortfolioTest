				<div>
				I mainly use C++ in order to solve programming problems and Daily Challenges in LeetCode. Its my first language and purposely one I learned for getting the hang of how Data Structures work. The process of solving algorithm problems is still not an easy one for me but I can tell that im learning alot of abstract things such as ways to approach a problem on first glance, and trying to keep up with the requirements. 
				</div>	
				<div>
				I know a bit of Java as a school requirement, but I'm still in the process of translating my C++ data structures knowledge to Java programming language in order to be more comfortable with it. That aside, I think I see alot of my weaknesses when it comes to approaching how GUI designs work.
				</div>
				<div>
				When it comes to Python, I think I could manage it to the level where I can simply do as needed for implementing Django related websites, however, I still have yet to tackle the subject of OOP and Data Structures as extensively as I did with either C++ or Java. Im relying alot on my surface level knowledge but I am having a good time.
				</div>
				<div>
				JavaScript. I feel like I have only made little progress thus far since it seems too deep a topic or a learning experience in order to feel average. I am very sure that I will have to learn this at some point and is currently my highest priority when it comes to self-study. But I am still trying to overcome my dissatisfaction with designing in general which I tend to struggle with.
